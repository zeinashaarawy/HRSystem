# HR Recruitment, Onboarding, and Offboarding Subsystem

This repository contains the **Recruitment, Onboarding, and Offboarding** subsystem of the HR Management System project.

The subsystem manages the full employee lifecycle:

- From candidate application and selection (Recruitment)
- To preparing the new hire for their first working day (Onboarding)
- To handling resignation or termination in a structured way (Offboarding)

All data is integrated with the global HR system and shared employee database.

## 1. Scope of This Subsystem

### 1.1 Recruitment

- Accept job applications from candidates
- Track candidate status (applied → screening → interview → offer → accepted/rejected)
- Store candidate information and notes
- When a candidate is hired, create an employee entry in the shared Employee collection
- Notify other modules that a new employee will join (Organization Structure, Payroll, Employee Profile)

### 1.2 Onboarding

- Create onboarding tasks for a new hire (e.g., contracts, accounts, equipment, payroll forms)
- Assign onboarding tasks to HR or responsible staff
- Track the completion status of onboarding tasks
- Mark onboarding as complete and trigger:
  - Payroll initialization (basic salary, start date)
  - Organizational assignment (department, position)

### 1.3 Offboarding

- Initiate offboarding when an employee resigns or is terminated
- Generate a clearance checklist (return equipment, disable accounts, handover, etc.)
- Track completion of clearance items
- Coordinate with:
  - Payroll for final settlement
  - Organization Structure to free the position
  - Employee Profile to deactivate the employee

## 2. Technology Stack (Planned)

This subsystem is planned to use:

- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Backend:** NestJS (TypeScript)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication (shared with main system)
- **HTTP Client:** Axios for calling other subsystems' APIs
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) and Heroku/Render (backend) – to be finalized later

For Milestone 1, only the **design and planning** are required (no full implementation yet).
